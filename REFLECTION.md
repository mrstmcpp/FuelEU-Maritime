## What I learned using AI agents

- First of all improves speed.
- Now,  we don't have to manually go to Stack Overflow or Baeldung/Medium articles to understand and refractor the code & logic.
- Now, we can focus more on having clean architecture and business logics instead of writing code.
- Learned to use multi-agent at once. It helped a lot.
- Learned One of the most loved thing by me which is, we can ask for best practices which is being used in the industry. 


## Efficiency gains vs manual coding

- Inline completions by Copilot is very handy and fast.
- Automated file refractorings by Cursor is on next level, it saved alot of my time. Through this process, I learned that AI excels when guided with specific, contextual prompts & clarity.
I don't know whether chatgpt or any agents tells me correct or not bt yes it is very helpful in some cases.
- manually, I would have lost on internet searching for correct one working solution.


## Improvements I'd make next time
- I will try to use some central data which can be used by any agent I m using. So, that they can give right outputs.
- Gonna guide it more and ask for best practices more frequently. Also, will keep asking more alternatives and trade offs.
